# OS-Schedulling-Algorithms

This project simulates the working of different CPU Schedulling Algorithms

The project is made using Javafx as Frontend and Java as Backend. 

The Project will ask the user to input Arrival time, Burst time, Time Slice and Priority (Depending on the schedulling algorithm the user wants to implement). It will then calculate the Waiting time, Turn Around time, Average Waiting time and Average Turn Around time and display it to the user.
